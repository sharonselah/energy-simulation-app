# Multi-Device Comparison Integration Tests

## Summary

**Test File:** `multi-device-comparison.integration.test.tsx`  
**Total Tests:** 9  
**Status:** ✅ All Passing  
**Test Type:** Integration tests focusing on end-to-end user flows

## Overview

These tests verify the multi-device comparison feature, which is the core functionality of Phase 8. They test realistic user journeys through the application, ensuring that users can successfully add multiple devices, configure them, and view aggregated cost comparisons.

## Test Philosophy

- **Quality over Quantity**: Fewer, comprehensive tests that cover complete user flows
- **Integration-focused**: Tests real component interactions and user journeys
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests mirror actual user behavior patterns
- **Maintainable**: Tests are clear, well-documented, and easy to understand

## Test Suite Breakdown

### 1. Core User Flows (7 tests)

#### Test 1: Complete Multi-Device Workflow ⭐
**Purpose:** Tests the full happy path from start to finish  
**Coverage:**
- Adding first device (Electric Pressure Cooker with LPG fuel)
- Configuring device with alternative fuel
- Adding second device (Electric Water Heater)
- Verifying device list with 2 devices
- Checking aggregated savings calculations
- Verifying currency displays (Ksh)

**Why Important:** This is the most critical test - if this passes, the core feature works.

#### Test 2: Device Removal
**Purpose:** Verifies users can remove individual devices  
**Coverage:**
- Adding two devices
- Removing one device using delete button
- Verifying device count updates correctly
- Checking remaining device persists

**Why Important:** Users need to manage their device list effectively.

---

#### Test 3: Clear All Functionality
**Purpose:** Tests bulk removal of all devices  
**Coverage:**
- Adding a device
- Clicking "Clear All" button
- Verifying empty state displays
- Checking for "No Devices Added Yet" message

**Why Important:** Users should be able to start over easily.

---

#### Test 4: Mixed Device Types
**Purpose:** Ensures different device categories work together  
**Coverage:**
- Adding Electric Fan
- Adding Electric Water Heater
- Verifying both appear in list
- Checking combined savings calculation

**Why Important:** Real users will compare different appliance types.

---

#### Test 5: Empty State
**Purpose:** Tests initial state when no devices added  
**Coverage:**
- Rendering with no devices
- Verifying empty state message
- Checking "Add Your First Device" button exists

**Why Important:** Good UX requires clear empty states.

---

#### Test 6: Device Card Expansion
**Purpose:** Tests expand/collapse functionality for device details  
**Coverage:**
- Adding a device
- Expanding device card to show details
- Verifying Scenario A, B, C displays
- Collapsing card
- Verifying details hidden

**Why Important:** Users need to drill down into individual device costs.

---

#### Test 7: Savings Calculations
**Purpose:** Verifies savings are calculated and displayed correctly  
**Coverage:**
- Adding two devices
- Checking individual device savings
- Verifying combined savings display
- Checking monthly and annual projections
- Verifying currency format (Ksh)

**Why Important:** Accurate cost calculations are the core value proposition.

---

### 2. Context Integration (2 tests)

#### Test 8: State Persistence
**Purpose:** Ensures React context maintains state across updates  
**Coverage:**
- Adding a device
- Re-rendering component
- Verifying device persists after rerender

**Why Important:** Context management is critical for app stability.

---

#### Test 9: Cost Aggregation
**Purpose:** Verifies multi-device cost aggregation  
**Coverage:**
- Adding two devices
- Checking combined savings calculation
- Verifying aggregated amounts display correctly

**Why Important:** Multi-device totals must be accurate.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all multi-device tests
pnpm test -- multi-device-comparison.integration.test.tsx

# Run with verbose output
pnpm test -- multi-device-comparison.integration.test.tsx --verbose

# Run specific test
pnpm test -- multi-device-comparison.integration.test.tsx -t "should complete full"
```

## Test Statistics

- **Total Execution Time:** ~10-13 seconds
- **Average Test Duration:** 700-900ms
- **Longest Test:** Complete workflow (~1.6s)
- **Shortest Test:** Empty state (~25ms)
- **Success Rate:** 100% (9/9 passing)

## Key Testing Patterns Used

### 1. User-Centric Flow Testing
Tests follow actual user journeys, not just testing individual functions in isolation.

### 2. Comprehensive Assertions
Each test verifies multiple aspects:
- UI state changes
- Data accuracy
- User feedback elements
- Navigation flow

### 3. Realistic Interactions
- Uses `userEvent` for realistic user interactions
- Includes proper waiting with `waitFor`
- Tests async state updates properly

### 4. Context Provider Testing
All tests wrap components in `AppProvider` to test real context integration.

## Devices Used in Tests

The tests use the following devices from the actual device catalog:
- Electric Pressure Cooker (EPC) - 1000W, cooking
- Electric Water Heater - 3000W, heating
- Electric Fan - appliance
- Electric Iron - appliance

## Common Test Helpers

```typescript
// Helper to render with context
function renderWithContext(component: React.ReactElement) {
  return render(<AppProvider>{component}</AppProvider>);
}
```

## Maintenance Notes

### When to Update These Tests

1. **UI Changes:** If button text or component structure changes
2. **New Features:** Add tests for new multi-device functionality
3. **Bug Fixes:** Add regression tests for fixed bugs
4. **Device Catalog Changes:** Update device names if constants change

### Test Fragility Considerations

These tests are intentionally written to be:
- **Resilient** to minor UI changes (uses semantic queries)
- **Flexible** with timing (proper use of `waitFor`)
- **Clear** about intent (well-documented with comments)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the test suite:
1. Time block conflict handling across devices
2. Alternative fuel cost calculations verification
3. Load profile aggregation testing
4. History/save functionality testing
5. Report generation for multiple devices
